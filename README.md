# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset. The goal is to identify which passenger groups (by age, gender, class) had the highest survival rates.

## 📊 Key Findings
* **Money Matters:** 1st Class passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than 3rd Class.
* **Gender:** Females had a much higher chance of survival, confirming the "Women and Children First" rule.
* **Age:** The majority of passengers were 25-30 years old. Missing age data was handled using Median Imputation.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
* **Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib
* **Techniques:** Data Cleaning, Missing Value Imputation, Correlation Analysis

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `EDA.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells to see the analysis and graphs.
